# happiness_models

Central question: how might we predict a country's happiness index from the average health score of its citizens?

Approach:\
1. Complete exploratory analysis of the dataset to see if there are any interesting features.
2. Create models (normal, T, outlier classifier, heteroscedastic).
3. Interpret the models, and make comparisons (which model fits the data best, which makes the best predictions).
